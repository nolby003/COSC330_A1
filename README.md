# Parallel Search Keyspace
File: parallel_search_keyspace.c
### Program demonstrates the use of pipes (ring of processes) to brute-force search for an AES encryption key given a partial key.

This project was developed as part of my University course Parallel and Distributed Computing (COSC330) for my degree in BcompSci.
